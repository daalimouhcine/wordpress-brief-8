We were tired of the bloated and buggy contact form builder plugins. That's why we built WPForms to adapt to your workflow and allow you to create custom contact forms in minutes.

> Bill Erickson - Expert WordPress Consultant

= Pre-built Form Templates =

Building contact forms in WordPress can be time consuming. Why?

Because every other WordPress contact form builder plugin requires you to build your contact form from scratch. The truth is it's often not necessary to create a contact form completely from scratch unless you really want to.

Whether you're looking to create a simple contact form, marketing form, request a quote form, donation form, payment order form, registration form, or a subscription form, we have a form template for you inside our contact form builder.

WPForms comes with <a href="https://wpforms.com/features/form-templates/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend">pre-built form templates</a> to help you save time. You can add, remove, or re-arrange fields as necessary.

See <a href="https://wpforms.com/templates/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend">300+ Pre-Made WPForms Form Template Demo</a>

= Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly and Optimized for Speed =

WPForms' contact forms are 100% responsive and mobile-friendly by default. We also optimized every query on the front-end and the back-end to ensure maximum speed - Yes, WPForms is one of the fastest WordPress contact form plugin.

You can embed your contact form on any page with optimized title and description. With the speed and proper formatting, WPForms is also one of the most SEO friendly contact form plugin.

You can easily integrate your contact forms with an email marketing service or collect payments for bookings and orders. WPForms allows you to do it all.

The best part is, you can do it all without hiring a developer.

>As a business owner, time is my most valuable asset. WPForms allow me to create smart contact forms with just a few clicks. With their pre-built form templates and the drag & drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.<br>
> David Henzel - Co-founder of MaxCDN

= Surveys & Polls =

Along with contact form, you can also use WPForms to create surveys and polls.

Our <a href="https://wpforms.com/addons/surveys-and-polls-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend">WordPress Survey plugin addon</a> comes with smart survey fields including likert scale, star ratings, multiple choice, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and more, so you can create custom survey forms like Survey Monkey (without the high costs).

WPForms offer the best-in class survey reporting. You can use our interactive reports to customize the graphs, export them for your presentations, and even display the aggregate results to your users.

The best part about WPForms survey reports is that it can retroactively work on any old contact form or feedback survey contact form created with WPForms.

Thousands of businesses love WPForms surveys for creating employee feedback form, customer feedback form, online petition form, and more.

You can also use the surveys & polls addon to easily create a poll on your site. To save you time when creating a user poll, we have added a built-in poll forms template. Our poll feature offers real-time reports, so you can share poll results with the user immediately after they submit their vote.

Just like the contact form, you can embed your surveys and polls inside any post, page, or widget area in WordPress.

= Membership and Default WordPress Forms =

Aside from building simple contact forms which every WordPress site needs, WPForms also helps you create better default WordPress forms.

For example, you can use WPForms to create custom WordPress login forms and custom WordPress user registration forms which are great for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/ultimate-guide-to-creating-a-wordpress-membership-site/">membership sites</a>.

For membership sites, you can also use WPForms to create a password-protected contact form or even a members only contact form which is restricted to logged-in users only.

Even if you're not using a WordPress membership plugin, you can use WPForms to create membership registration forms, online RSVP forms, and other address book contact forms.

Bloggers and publishers can use our WordPress post submission forms to accept guest posts, testimonials contact form to collect testimonials, and partnership agreement forms to grow their business.

= Payment Form, Donation Form, Booking Form, and More =

While WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful custom forms solution that you can use to create a payment form, donation form, registration form, online booking form, mobile form, and basically any type of custom form you need.

WPForms integrates with both PayPal, Stripe, Square, and Authorize.Net so you can easily create a credit card payment form to accept payments on your website. If you're using SSL, then you can use our Stripe, Square, or Authorize.Net Payment forms to accept credit card payments directly on your website. Alternatively you can use our PayPal payment form to make a donation form and accept payments online.

Aside from simple order forms, business owners also use WPForms to create custom product purchase forms, t-shirt order forms, online booking forms, and more.

We understand that sometimes you may need to create a contact form that require a signature. WPForms comes with a signature field to collect user signature on your WordPress forms or even create custom signature forms.

You can do all of this while still using the same easy-to-use contact form builder that's loved by over 5 million users.

> Micky73 - WordPress user

= Forms that are Optimized for Conversion and Results =

With our Form Pages addon, you can create distraction-free custom form landing pages like Google Forms and Wufoo right inside WordPress, so you can increase conversions without the high costs (<a href="https://wpforms.com/addons/form-pages-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend">See Form Pages Demo</a>).

To improve form completion rate, we created Conversational Forms&reg; which helps you make your generic feedback form and other custom contact forms feel more human by adding an interactive form layout. Our conversational forms are similar to Typeform without the high subscription costs (<a href="https://wpforms.com/addons/conversational-forms-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend">See Conversational Forms Demo</a>).

WPForms also has other conversion optimization features such as our smart form logic that lets you create dynamic contact forms where fields change based on user's answer, multi-page contact forms with progress bar, and other advanced contact forms.

WPForms form analytics integration with MonsterInsights allow you to easily track your lead capture forms, newsletter signup forms, request a quote contact form, and other important forms on your site.

= Easy to Customize and Extend =

You can easily customize your contact forms with our section dividers, HTML blocks, and custom CSS.

If you're using Elementor or Divi page builders our native integrations let you quickly customize the style of your forms. Embedding forms in Elementor and Divi has never been easier.

We also knew that our developer friends may want to extend simple contact forms further. That's why WPForms come with tons of hooks and filters to create custom functionality.

Since contact forms are essential for marketing, WPForms is a must have plugin for every website!

If you're not happy with your WordPress contact form plugin, then definitely give WPForms a try!

= I'd like access to all features. How can I get them? =

You can get access to more features, addons and support by <a href="https://wpforms.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend" title="Click here to learn more about WPForms!">upgrading to our Pro version</a>. Purchasing a Pro license gets you access to the full version of WPForms, automatic updates, priority support, and all WPForms Addons!

= Is WPForms translation ready? =

Yes, WPForms has full translation and localization support via the wpforms textdomain. Based on your site language, required .mo and .po translation files will be downloaded and placed into the default WordPress languages directory. The same is true for every WPForms Addon as well.

= Does WPForms include spam protection? =

Yes, WPForms includes spam protection which is enabled on all forms by default in the form settings.

Additionally, Google reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha are also supported and can be set up at WPForms > Settings > CAPTCHA.

WPForms is fully compatible with all versions of Google reCAPTCHA:

* Checkbox reCAPTCHA v2
* Invisible reCAPTCHA v2
* reCAPTCHA v3

Lastly, <a href="https://wpforms.com/addons/custom-catpcha-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend">Custom Captchas</a> are available which allow you to create math or question based captchas for your contact forms.

== Notes ==

WPForms is absolutely, positively the most <a href="https://wpforms.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend" title="Best WordPress contact form plugin">beginner friendly WordPress contact form plugin</a> on the market. It is both easy and powerful.

We took the pain out of creating online forms and made it easy. Check out all <a href="https://wpforms.com/features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend">WPForms features</a>.

Also, I'm the founder of <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/" rel="friend">WPBeginner</a>, the largest WordPress resource site for beginners. It was a huge priority for me to make a WordPress contact form plugin that beginners can use without any training.

I feel that we have done that here. I hope you enjoy using WPForms.

Thank you
